# Project-MM
Collaborative web development project created over the course of my first year web development course. Made by my group, Fifty/Fifty, an esports site displaying news and information related to select esports games, and includes a functional account creation system and session-based login. Requires a local web server in order to run PHP code and save user sign-up credentials; something like XAMPP would work great.
